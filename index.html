            At High Falutin High, the arts high school in her home town, Daisy Fontana fell in love. Not with a boy, or
            even
            with a
            girl, for that matter, but with something altogether more interesting: web design. Instead of a BFF, she had
            CSS.
            Instead of singing and dancing with the other kids, she spent her time coding alone. But when she graduated
            and
            moved to
            the city to find a job, she knew everything about HTML, but nothing about life. Will the town eat her alive,
            or
            will she
            survive and rise to the top of the cutthroat world of coding websites? Daisy Fontana is a nerd heroine for
            our
            times,
            and <i>The Web Designer</i> tells her gripping tale.

                <p class="testimonial">“I’ve never seen a novel with so much HTML
                    and CSS code. I mean there is a <em>lot</em> of code in this book!
                    So much code. Code, code, code.” —T. J. Murphy, Nowhere, OK</p>
                <p class="testimonial">“I particularly loved the scenes where
                    Daisy is by herself in her room writing HTML and CSS. It’s hard
                    to make writing tags and properties interesting, and the author
                    almost does it.” —M. Dash, Tightwad, MO</p>
                <p class="testimonial">“I couldn’t put it down. No, really, I
                    could <em>not</em> physically put this book down. Thanks to the
                    cheap cover stock, the book was literally glued to my hands. I
                    had to go to the emergency room to get the thing off me.” —A.
